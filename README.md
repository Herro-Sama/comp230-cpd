# Weekly Reports

## Week Zero/Summer
During my summer I have spent time doing some minor work in Unity looking at Hex based programming and design.

I also spent time working with the first years helping out during the robot olympics/robot wars and spending time getting to know some of them.

## Week One
During my first week I have started my Ethics and Professionalism Research and created my proposal for my desired topic, which is based on gambling and it's influences within video gaming.

I finished my world pitch and began practicing timings. Started working with my group to create a prototype of our game concept.

Started work with OpenGL working on creating a triangle.
