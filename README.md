# Weekly Reports

## Week Zero/Summer
During my summer I have spent time doing some minor work in Unity looking at Hex based programming and design.

I also spent time working with the first years helping out during the robot olympics/robot wars and spending time getting to know some of them.

## Week One
During my first week I have started my Ethics and Professionalism Research and created my proposal for my desired topic, which is based on gambling and it's influences within video gaming.

I finished my world pitch and began practicing timings. Started working with my group to create a prototype of our game concept.

Started work with OpenGL working on creating a triangle.

## Week Two
During this week I worked on expanding my references for the Ethics and Professionalism essay, I have also begun to look at some papers regarding AR/VR. 

I did furter work on a prototype for the group project, working on the Taco Truck game I was working on driving mechanics.

I also made minor changes to the Website for Comp210, however much more work needs to go into the website before it is finished.

## Week Three
In week three we began working on a new prototype called wacky guns, I however didn't contribute much to this prototype as I was instead working mainly on planning out my reasarch for my Comp210 usability report.

## Week Four
During week four I have found that spent a lot of time doing my usability survey, and collecting data points however I still have a lot of work that needs to be done to the website hosting my usability report.
