# Semester Two
## Week One
During the break, my team and I have been making a different game. This is because we felt that our original game didn't work in the way we had hoped so we took it in a new direction instead.

## Week Two
It's quite interesting the more we explore the various areas surrounding networking it doesn't seem to be nearly as scary as I had initally thought it would have been. I still think that it's probably very difficult to make something good but getting devices to talk to each other doesn't seem as bad at least.

## Week Three
Business seems incredibly easy compared to getting the actual servers and the AI game components done.

## Week Four
Been really struggling with my game component as it's not really working yet. Neural networks are hard, to implement and get working.

## Week Five
Presenting the business case I thought would have been a bigger deal but it wasn't, the group game is still progressing at an okay rate though it has certainly dipped since the Janurary.

## Week Six
Just spent time working on the game project, though it certainly needs more work especially with animations however our animator doesn't seem to be able to make it in or consistenly do work.

## Week Seven
Pathfinding was actually a really interesting lecture, though I still feel like there must be a more efficent heuristic for finding a path, that however is probably a PHD question rather than something that I will actually have to think about properly.

## Week Eight
I haven't actually looked at my server stuff since the last hand-in, which is worrying me as we are getting more and more complex things to deal with going forward. I still haven't been able to get my Virtual Linux machine to work, so I will need to get help with that quite soon.

## Week Nine
The issue, I have had with this weeks lecture on Neural networks is that I really needed the information about this much earlier than I got it. It was still very interesting but I knew most of the information from my own research for my game component piece, which still doesn't work.

## Week Ten


## Week Eleven


## Week Twelve
I really enjoyed the lecture on the ethics of AI, I still really enjoy the debating of what is an ethical choice for AI to make and should they be allowed to guess at certain information.
