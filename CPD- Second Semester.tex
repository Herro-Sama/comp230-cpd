1 .
Specific - I want to have a much more active role during the development phase of my group game, rather than being passive and waiting to see what work needs to be done. I think that this will be an important skill to develop for future development, though I will also need to make sure that the work I'm doing is going to make the game better rather than just show I'm doing work.
Measurable - This should be directly linked to the amount of commits I make during the production phase of development and should make the crunch time spike look much smaller,
