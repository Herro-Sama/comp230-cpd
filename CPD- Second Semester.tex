\section{Be More Active during the development phase rather than passively working through things.}

Specific - I want to have a much more active role during the development phase of my group game, rather than being passive and waiting to see what work needs to be done. I think that this will be an important skill to develop for future development, though I will also need to make sure that the work I'm doing is going to make the game better rather than just show I'm doing work.
Measurable - This should be directly linked to the amount of commits I make during the production phase of development and should make the crunch time spike look much smaller,
Actionable - I'm going to spend more time interacting with the various designers in the team and working more closely to ensure that I should always know what we are working on.
Reasonable - This shouldn't be very difficult, as we have very few programmers and so designers will have to try and cover that slack.
Time frame - I plan to being doing this for my next group project which will be starting over the summer, this should be pretty evident that I have achieved this once we get back during September.

\section{Make time to fail, and experiment with things that don't work and to not be afraid to do that.}

Specific - I want to be less afraid to try new things and experiment with new systems even if they don't work.
Measurable - This is something that I will have to do going forward as we have so few programmers on my team for next year, I will be measuring this in my ability to general programming/blueprint tasks in Unreal Engine 4. 
Actionable - This is something I will be developing over the summer during the prototyping phase, as I will need to be able to develop any number of gameplay features that the new game may need.
Reasonable - This is something that I will have to do, and shouldn't be anything beyond what you would expect of a gameplay programmer, building those core gameplay programming skills will probably be very important going forward into the industry.
Time frame - I will be working on these skills over the next few months mainly from May until July, with my group settling on their final choice by August.

\section{Take regularly scheduled breaks rather than just being distracted after working for large amounts of time.}

Specific - Take time to have breaks everyday so I have a designated distraction time.
Measurable - Having a planned out set-time each day should be quite easy to observe, and it should be something that across development people will be able to see.
Actionable - I will make my group aware of when I am taking a break from doing group work to have a break and refocus myself.
Reasonable - This shouldn't be too difficult, I plan to use a similar break system from when I worked at a contact centre of giving myself a fifteen minute break for roughly every three to four hours of work I have done.
Time frame - This is something I will be doing starting from when my new group begins working and I will begin from day one with them.

\section{Start my day earlier, so I can consistently arrive for early morning meetings.}

Specific - Be more consistent with arriving for earlier meetings, especially in very cold weather.
Measurable - This should be easy to see as I should have better attendance for stand-up meeting etc. in general.
Actionable - I will trying to wake up significantly earlier for these meetings to try and ensure that I am awake and ready to leave, rather than only giving myself a few minutes to get up and ready each day,
Reasonable - I think this will be very difficult to accomplish but will be very important for maximising the amount of time I can spend getting work done with my group for next year.
Time frame - The time frame will be properly tested once we arrive back in september and the weather starts to get colder but it should be clear if I have achieved this as I will be in more as a result.

\section{Be more organised about deadlines and work that needs to be done.}
