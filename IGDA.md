## What are your career objectives, and how will attending this event help you to achieve them? *

I am pursuing a career as a technical designer with the aims of progressing to becoming the creative lead or game director for AAA projects. Getting an IGDA Scholarship will help me to achieve this by giving me a chance to meet and learn from industry veterans as well as the talks provided during the GDC event.

As I am already doing a computing degree I think it's important for me to attend more of the design and business talks rather than programming talks. This is so I can hear about the current design practices used within the industry, and to expand my understanding of the business aspect of games development.

The talks I would like to attend are the following:

Art Direction for AAA UI - Omer Younas

Commandos with Ninja: A 'Shadow Tactics' Postmortem - Moritz Wagner

'Good Pizza, Great Pizza': Game Design, Iteration, and Business Lessons 
Learned - Anthony Lai

'Crashlands': Design by Chaos - Seth Coster

Creating a Development Culture that Embraces Change - Conor Crowley

Rules of the Game: Five Further Techniques from Rather Clever Designers 

Multi-Platform Production from Day Zero - Ido Yehieli

Games as Medicine: FDA Approval Methods - Noah Falstein

## What is your favorite game and why? (This can be analog, digital, or interactive media) *

I don't think I could say I have a favourite game, I have played games from a very young age and as a result have been a part of my life for a very long time. I won't go so far as to say I love all games, but certainly a lot of them. 

I would say that I have enjoyed games that could be considered cybertexts, simply because I find them more immersive. Games from franchises like Mass Effect, Grand Theft Auto, The Elder Scrolls, Metal Gear and Halo.

Though I try to get my hands on as wide a variety of games as possible from the  likes of Starcraft and Warcraft all the way to games like Freelancer. With indie games thrown into the mix like that of Terraria, Project Zomboid, They are Billions and Super Hexagon.

Games in general have inspired me to pursue a career in games development because I want to be apart of the game making process creates games that can help to teach, inspire and make people feel things. I can't think of a more powerful platform to reach out to people.

## How are you currently volunteering within the game development community, your student community, and/or outside of the games community? *

I have spent time volunteering mostly to help teach programming using Scratch, Pygame, and working with Raspberry Pi and Micro bits. 

I have helped with many outreach programs to help teach young teens Python with Pygame. 

Very recently I was helping teachers learn basic programming skills using a Raspberry Pi and Micro bits as well as covering other tools they could use like SonicPi and RoboCode to take back to their classrooms and get the students more interested in programming. 

I have also helped at a girls can code event to encourage young girls from girl scouts to get involved with programming, during this event I was helping to teach Scratch to the very young scouts to help them create small games or animations.

Some of my other commitments I have undertaken include becoming a student representative, which means I bring student feedback to formal meetings to help improve the course.

I'm also a champion of our programmers guild, which means I help to facilitate various activities or workshops with programmers across all the year groups, from organising and running game jams which take can take the form of Designer and programmer jams or having to create a specific game mechanic with a novel twist or programming tournaments to program the best AI agents.  

Finally I'm a Student Mentor, which means I check in on the first year BSc students to help give them guidance and make sure they are settled in and give tips about their coursework.

## Describe a game-related project (personal or academic) in which you've participated and explain your role in the project. *

One of my favourite game projects, was actually the 2017 Global Game Jam game that I worked on. It was called Hyper Heatwave Runner (The theme was "Wave") and was an endless runner style game.

This was my first ever project using Unity and because of the time constraints of the game jam, I had to learn the C# library for Unity while trying to make the game. I was primarily doing programming but also helped in the designing, and I was liaising between the artists and organising the other programmers to make sure all the work was getting done on time. The programming team like myself were new to Unity and decided to spend our time mob programming, however I was usually the driver in these situations.

The core tasks I worked on were creating the main menu, character controller, creating the item spawner and then integrating the various information for the game and having it displayed on screen within the UI, like score and health, though I also helped to bring art into the game, getting a parallax background working and making sure the player character had working animations.

Although I'm very happy with the end result and of the work that the team and I put into the game, I learned a lot and reflectively can see many potential areas of improvement which could be explored to help improve the users experience.

## Describe a moment on a project where you inspired a team member, failed completely, or were forced to discover and learn something new. *

One of the key challenges that I have faced in working with diverse teams, with such a wide split of specialisms and commitments has been finding ways to reduce or resolve conflicts with teammates regardless of their personality. Although I believe I am a decent team player, I know that I can still improve and I try to do so with every game project and every conflict.

I often spend time reflectively thinking about conflicts that occurred and considering ways in which different approaches and techniques could be applied to improve the outcome of similar conflicts in the future. I'm always trying to understand issues from all of the angles and to understand why teammates have a different opinion on certain aspects so I can either directly resolve them or mediate between teammates to make sure issues are resolved.

I would count my greatest failure as not being able to full understand or relate to certain personality types, where their motivations and commitment to the project don't seem clear to me. It's always been my belief that any member of a team has a responsibility to try and improve their team if they can. That to me means helping to motivate, encourage, teach or sometimes just give a new perspective to issues they may be facing.

## How can developers shape the future? *

Games are a huge part of my life, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without them. They are a force not just for entertainment but also for education, health and well-being.

The Drama practitioner called Bertolt Brecht said that "Art is not a mirror to be held up to reality but a hammer with which to shape it." I think that games are a form of art but they can reach people in a ways that traditional art forms simply can't, they could be used to help promote a positive change for people all over the world teaching them new skills or giving them unique insights into different cultures or history.

I believe that games can do a huge amount of good to improve the life of those who play them, like giving encouragement and information to those suffering from mental illness or helping those who suffer from social anxiety to build up confidence and learn ways to help engage with others more easily. 

As game developers we should be using this power we have to help make people's lives better, but that doesn't mean every game has to try to change the whole world. We sometimes just need to make games that people can play to help them forget about the stress of their day, but it's always worth remembering the power a game has and the impact it can have on it's users to bring about a positive change in the world.

## What attributes would you look for in a mentor and why would you find that beneficial? *
I would like my mentor to be a lead designer or programmer in a AAA company, though if you happen to have a creative lead or game director I would love to speak with them. If they have had experience working within different companies I would also like to hear about how their time within the companies.

I'm mostly interested in learning about the career path my mentor had to get to where they are now, and what the criteria were for them to advance to that position. Having the chance to engage with someone with a lead position I feel will be incredibly helpful to get first hand knowledge of what is expected of a lead within a AAA company as well as how to best prepare myself for the role in the future.
