# Things to work on

1. Don't be afraid of confontation, as a way of resolving issues.

2. Not focusing on the things I find interesting or easy at the expense of doing other work.

3. Spend more time doing my own work and less time helping others when I have work todo.

4. Cutting down on time spent distracted by non-work related things.

5. Spend some time working with C++ learning a lot more of the pure C++ skills.
